          platform and you are almost ready to launch your {this.getProductName()}
          beer release.
        </p>

        <h3>What&rsquo;s Next:</h3>

        <p>
          Scott or Pat, Brewline&rsquo;s founders, will reach out to make sure
          all the boxes are checked to begin selling (e.g., setting up an
          account with Stripe, so you can get paid; creating a subdomain on
          brewline.io for your shop; creating purchase limits; etc.). Afterward
          your shop will be activated and you may begin pre-selling your next
          beer release.
        </p>

        <p>
          Until then, you can visit your shop and update any of its information,
          import additional beers, add new beers or products, set available
          quantities and limits, or just explore.
        </p>
