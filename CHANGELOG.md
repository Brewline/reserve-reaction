# v1.11.0

The major focus of `v1.11.0` has been on our GraphQL API. We've added most of the queries and mutations that are necessary for building a headless client to interact with `Accounts`. We're actively doing experiments on how we'll recommend connecting to this GraphQL client and we'll start publishing some of our initial client apps to interact with this GraphQL API in the near future.

# v1.10.0

## Collection Hooks | Breaking Change!
The biggest change in 1.10.0 is the removal of the [meteor-collection-hooks](https://github.com/matb33/meteor-collection-hooks) package. If your app or plugin is dependent on collection hooks, we'd recommend refactoring to eliminate the need for those types of hooks. If you're not up for refactoring you can just add that package back into your app though you'll lose some of the benefits that Reaction will see by eliminating that dependency. The removal of this package is a breaking change for any plugin that depends on collection hooks or uses the `direct` method to update a collection. For example, `Products.before`, `Products.after`, and `Products.direct` will no longer work. These hooks have all been migrated to our event hook system. If you were using Collection hooks to perform an action that you cannot perform in 1.10.0 with the current set of event hooks, please file an issue and we can determine if we need to add additional event hooks. This change should lead to much simpler code that is easier to understand.

## New GraphQL API
In addition to a few performance updates, refactors, and bug fixes, this release starts the rollout of our GraphQL API. Until further notice, this GraphQL API should be considered a prototype and should not be used for production. If you're interested in following along with our GraphQL work, tracking our [GraphQL issues](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+graphql+) is probably the easiest way for now.

In short, this release adds a prototype GraphQL server running in the Reaction project with the following urls exposed:

```
/graphql - The GraphQL endpoint.
/graphiql - The GraphiQL user interface.
```

We'll be incrementally adding functionality to this GraphQL endpoint, but this release serves as the starting point for our GraphQL api.

# v1.9.0
This release contains a lot of fixes, some of them performance related and several enormous refactors.
The three biggest changes are:
1. We've migrated from the Meteor version of Simple Schema to the npm version. See notes in the breaking changes section below.
2. We've dropped our dependency on the deprecated Meteor-CollectionFS package. We've replaced it with an npm package we've created called [reaction-file-collections](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-file-collections)
3. We've created a new catalog collection for use on the Product Grid when viewed by a consumer or other user without a product admin role

There's a full list of changes and fixes below, as well as detailed explanations of potential breaking changes and what you might need to do to migrate

## BREAKING CHANGES
This is a breaking change for any plugin that implements or modifies a schema based on the Meteor simple-schema package.

### From the Simple Schema update
This PR updates the `aldeed:simple-schema` Meteor package dependency to instead depend on the `simpl-schema` NPM package, which is the newest release of the same library. As part of this change, there are several breaking changes and other gotchas to be aware of.

IMPORTANT! The NPM package does not play nice with the previous Meteor package. After updating to this Reaction release, run the app one time, and then look at the .meteor/versions file. Make sure that aldeed:simple-schema is not listed. If it is there, that is because you depend on another Meteor package that depends on aldeed:simple-schema. You will have to update or remove any such packages (with meteor remove / meteor add) until aldeed:simple-schema disappears from your .meteor/versions file.
Search your app for any import { SimpleSchema } from "meteor/aldeed:simple-schema" lines that you have added in your custom code, and replace them with import SimpleSchema from "simpl-schema"
Be aware that the package name does not have the "e" on "simpl". (There is a different NPM package called simple-schema with the "e", and that is NOT the one you want.)
If you have your own custom schemas, refer to the SimpleSchema changelog to update them for the breaking changes: https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-simple-schema/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#200
If you use attachSchema in your code, be aware that passing an array to attachSchema will no longer work. You should first merge all the schemas and then pass the combined schema to attachSchema

Please read the PR if you need more details [Use NPM SimpleSchema rather than Meteor #3331](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/3331)

### From the removal of CollecitonFS
#### If you've saved the file URLs anywhere, they're now different.
```
/assets/files/:collectionName/:fileId/:filename
```
becomes
```
/assets/files/:collectionName/:fileId/:primaryStoreName/:filename
```

and
```
/assets/files/:collectionName/:fileId/:filename?store=storeName
```

becomes

```
/assets/files/:collectionName/:fileId/:storeName/:filename
```

#### We've deleted some unused Blaze templates rather than update URL handling within them:
- shopBrandImageOption
- ordersListItems
- select
- upload
- productMetaField
- productMetaFieldForm
- metaComponent
- productDetailEdit
- productDetailField
- productImageGallery
- imageDetail
- imageUploader
- productSocial
- variantList
- variant
- Media-related publishing is changed and improved:

#### Publications have been added, removed, or changed:
- `CartItemImage` publication is removed
- `CartImages` now takes an ID
- Added `ProductGridMedia` to replace Media being included with the products publication for the grid
- Added `ProductMedia`
- Added `OrderImages`, similar to `CartImages`, used for order now rather than reusing CartImages

Full notes on the PR to replace CFS #3782

### From the customer product catalog
The old `imports/plugins/included/product-variants/containers/productsContainer.js` has been renamed to `productsContainerAdmin.js` and a new component named `productsContainer.js` now handles which products container to load based on the user's permissions. Full notes on the PR #3876

### From the Dockerfile updates
reactioncommerce/base:v4.0.1 removed the following:
- Removed the conditional MongoDB installation (via $INSTALL_MONGO env). Use `mongo` as a service in docker-compose, see example in README.
- Removed the conditional PhantomJS installation (via $INSTALL_PHANTOMJS env). If PhantomJS is required in your build, you can include it in your custom Dockerfile.
Full notes on the PR

## Dockerfile Updates
- Base image updated to `reactioncommerce/base:v4.0.1` which has:
  - `node:8.9.4` as base image (same Debian base as before, but with Node 8 preinstalled)
  - Meteor 1.6.1 preinstalled
- [Multi-stage build support](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/).
  This helped reduce the size of the production image by removing un-required dependencies.
- Final production bundle uses `node:8.9.4-slim`

## Docker Compose changes
- Updated existing `docker-compose.yml` to serve as the config for running a local development environment.
- Added  a new `docker-compose-demo.yml` for testing out production builds (this is the replacement for the previous `docker-compose.yml`).
## Upgrades
- Use NPM SimpleSchema rather than Meteor (#3331)

## CI
We've updated our circle ci config to use [v2 of Workflows](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/). This permits us to run additional automated tests on circle instead of using other services. We now have 6 workflow steps that must pass before a PR can be merged.

# v1.8.0

## Meteor 1.6.1
This release upgrades Reaction to Meteor 1.6.1

This is a possible BREAKING CHANGE. We've done our best to keep core reaction backwards compatible with this release, but as this update includes bumping to Babel 7, if you have plugins that depend on Babel 6, they will break.
The [Meteor 1.6.1 announcement](https://blog.meteor.com/announcing-meteor-1-6-1-50aad71da4e6) or [release notes](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/master/History.md#v161-2018-01-19) are the best places to go for help debugging problems specific to Meteor introduced by this release. Additionally, you may want to check out Babel's own guide on [Upgrading to Babel 7](https://babeljs.io/blog/2017/03/01/upgrade-to-babel-7) or [Planning for Babel 7](https://babeljs.io/blog/2017/09/12/planning-for-7.0)

**The biggest change in this release is that we're upgrading to Babel 7.**
```
"@babel/runtime": "7.0.0-beta.38",
```

and in our `dev-dependencies`
```
"@babel/cli": "7.0.0-beta.38",
"@babel/core": "7.0.0-beta.38",
"@babel/preset-react": "7.0.0-beta.38",
"babel-preset-meteor": "7.0.0-beta.38-1"

```

Our babel presets now looks like this:
```
"presets": []
```
Yes, we've removed `stage-2` and `env` from our presets. That's recommended as meteor now includes `babel-preset-meteor`

Please see the PR #3615 for even more detail on what has changed in the update to Meteor 1.6.1


## ESLint
This release introduces the following changes to our .eslintrc file

#### jsx-a11y
We've added the recommended set of rules for [jsx-a11y](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y).
Reaction has always maintained a commitment to accessibility and adding this rule set provides linting rules to help enforce Aria and a11y compliance.

```
"extends": [
  "plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended"
],
```

#### Base rule set
We've added the following base eslint rules. You can find their descriptions and examples of failing and passing code here: https://eslint.org/docs/rules/

```

## Collection Hooks
We've removed the Collection Hooks package. This may be a breaking change if you're relying on Collection Hooks in your plugins. You can follow our examples to remove the Collection Hooks dependencies from your plugins or (not recommended) you can install the collection hooks meteor package back into your application without error.

#### We've replaced Accounts and Revisions Collection Hooks in #3642
- Replaced all Account & Revision .before, .after collection hooks to use Hooks.Events API.
- Updated Revisons.after.update(callback) to be Hooks.Events.add("afterRevisionUpdate", callback) and added Hooks.Events.run("afterRevisionUpdate", userId, revision) after every Revisons.update(...) call.
- Updated Accounts.after.insert(callback) to be Hooks.Events.add("afterAccountsInsert", callback) and added a Hooks.Events.run("afterAccountsInsert", userId, user) after every Accounts.insert(...) call.
- Updated Accounts.after.remove(callback) to be Hooks.Events.add("afterAccountsRemove", callback) and added a Hooks.Events.run("afterAccountsRemove", userId, user) after every
Accounts.remove(...) call.
- Updated Accounts.after.update(callback) to be Hooks.Events.add("afterAccountsUpdate", callback) and added a Hooks.Events.run("afterAccountsUpdate", userId, user) after every Accounts.update(...) call.
- Removed .direct from any Accounts or Revisions collection calls


## Breaking Changes
There are potentially breaking changes you should be aware of in this release.
  - (breaking, feat) CoreLayout should probe for React component as fallback (#3524) .. Resolves #3523
    A plugin which has named React components identically to Blaze templates in core may no longer work.
  - (breaking, refactor) Remove unnecessary code in Media subscription. (#3558) .. Resolves #3548
    We've renamed the `Media` subscription located in `client/modules/core/subscriptions.js`. This subscription's content has not changed, but is now more aptly named `BrandAssets`. This will only cause problems if you were subscribing to the `Media` publication seprately in your plugin.
  - (fix): remove "admin" permission from shop manager role (#3505) .. Resolves #3541
    We've removed the `admin` role from the default role set that is granted to the Shop Manager group. This should not affect any existing shops, but if you have plugins or users that rely on the `admin` role being granted to the Shop Manager group you may need to update your plugins.
  - (refactor): replace imagemagick with sharp (#3631) .. Resolves #3482
    This is only a breaking change if you have a plugin that depends on `gm`. It should be trivial to replace with `sharp` and this PR serves as an example of how to do so.
    Replace GraphicMagick/ImageMagick with sharp and remove dependency on `gm`
    Add sharp to the project and dynamically loads where necessary
    Update image transforms to to use the sharp() functions.
    Refactor the "Media" FS.Collection to map the image transforms through a buildGFS() function to create each FS.Store.GridFS collection.
  - (refactor): dynamically import moment.js (#3602) .. Resolves #2635
    Provides `withMoment` HOC to wrap components that use moment.
    May cause breaking changes if you relied on any of the following Blaze templates or helpers which are no longer used in core:
    Remove `timezoneOptions` Blaze template helper from `client/modules/core/helpers/templates.js`, as it's no longer used in any core files.
    Remove `ordersList`, `orderPage/details` and `orderPage` Blaze templates, which were replaced by React templates
    Move `dateFormat` Blaze template helper out of the global helpers, and into a specific template helper, since it's only used in one place
  - Babel 7 / Meteor 1.6.1 update mentioned in detail at the beginning of these release notes.

### Dependency Update
- (chore): update node dependencies (#3630)
  - Updates the following npm packages by a major version number: `babel-jest`, `jest`, `libphonenumber-js`
